Block Plus (module for Omeka S)
===============================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Block Plus] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds some new blocks for the static
pages and improves some of the existing ones.


Installation
------------

First, install the optional module [Generic].

The module uses external js libraries for some blocks, so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [BlockPlus.zip] from the list of releases (the
master does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `BlockPlus`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].


Usage
-----

Select them in the view "Page edit". You may theme them too: copy the block
templates that are in `view/common/block-layout/` in the same place of your
theme.

### Page Metadata

Allow to add a type to the page, so it’s simpler to have different templates for
different pages. It allows in particular to create exhibits inside a site,
without creating a new site.

You can add new types in the settings of the site. Then, in your theme, you can
get the page type `$pageType = $this->pageMetadata('type');` and many other data
about the page. If the page is an exhibit, it is possible to build a specific
navigation menu of this exhibit too, like in the site [Fondation de la Maison de Salins].

To manage multiple types, it’s generally required to edit the template "view/omeka/site/page/show.phtml"
of your theme and to add a check:

```php
// A simple check is done to make the theme more generic.
$pageMetadata = $plugins->has('pageMetadata') ? $plugins->get('pageMetadata') : null;
if ($pageMetadata):
    $type = $pageMetadata('type') ?: null;
    switch ($type):
        case 'home':
            $class = 'home';
            // Specific html code…
            break;
        case 'exhibit':
            $class = 'exhibit';
            // Specific html code…
            break;
        case 'exhibit_page':
            $class = 'exhibit-page';
            // Specific html code…
            break;
        case 'simple':
            $class = 'simple-page';
            // Specific html code…
            break;
        default:
            // Generic html code…
            $class = 'page';
            break;
    endswitch;
    $this->htmlElement('body')->appendAttribute('class', $class);
    // …
endif;
```

### Pages Metadata

This view helper allows to get the data of all pages of the same type in the
current site. For example, you can get all "exhibit_page". Multiple types can be
retrieved at once.

```php
// A simple check is done to make the theme more generic.
$pagesMetadata = $plugins->has('pagesMetadata') ? $plugins->get('pagesMetadata') : null;
if ($pagesMetadata):
    $data = $pagesMetadata('exhibit_page');
endif;
```

### Block Metadata

This view helper provides the same information than `pageMetadata()`, but from a
block. It is usefull with the simple block to extract params.

```php
// A simple check is done to make the theme more generic.
$blockMetadata = $plugins->has('blockMetadata') ? $plugins->get('blockMetadata') : null;
if ($blockMetadata):
    $data = $blockMetadata('params_key_value');
endif;
```

### Assets

Display a list of assets with optional urls and labels. It’s useful to build a
block of partners, for example. The assets are not required to be filled, so it
allow to display any list of contents.

### Simple block

A simple block allow to display a template from the theme. It may be used for a
static html content, like a list of partners, or a complex layout, since any
Omeka feature is available in a view.

An example layout is provided to display a dynamic tree view from a tsv/csv
file. The file should be one value by a row, with the offset matching the depth:

```
Asia
        Japan
                Tokyo
Europe
        France
                Paris
        Italy
                Roma
                Florence
```

### Mirror page

Allow to use a page as a block, so the same page can be use in multiple sites,
for example the page "About" or "Privacy". Of course, the page is a standard
page and can be more complex with multiple blocks. May be fun.
This is an equivalent for the [shortcode as a page] in [Omeka Classic] too.

### Resource with html

Simplify the display of a media on the left or the right (see [user guide]). It
is the same block that existed in [Omeka Classic] [Exhibit `file-text`].

### External content

Similar to media with html, but to display an external asset that is not a
resource neither an asset file, so currently not manageable inside Omeka. It may
be used to display a html text with a video on the home page.

### Search form

Include a specific search form in a specific page. The default query may be
adapted to the page via the theme.

### Search and results

Create a full search page with a simple or complex form and the results on the
same page. All options should be managed via the theme. To replace item/browse,
item-set/browse and even media/browse, you may need to set the page as default
action for the search in default template `common/search-form`.

### Twitter

Display the last messages from an account on [Twitter]. To use it, you may use
your own developer bearer token, else the module will try to use an anonymous
one.

Technical note: Since December 2020, it is required [to get a dev account] to
fetch messages of a user, because Twitter disabled any standard html endpoint
(see [this issue on StackOverflow]). If you use a dev account, it is not
necessarily the one of the thread to follow.

Nevertheless, it is still possible to fetch them with an anonymous bearer token.
To get it, check the urls in the dev tools of your browser in the "network" tab.
The token is set in the header of the requests to https://api.twitter.com with
the key `Authorization`, for example `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANRILgAAAAAAnNwIzUejRCOuH5E6I8xnZz4puTs%3D1Zv7ttfk8LF81IUq16cHjhLTvJu4FA33AGWWjCpTnA`.
This token will be available for the next two years, _or less_. Anyway, the
module fetches it automagically. Nevertheless, it uses some hard coded urls that
may change.

In all cases, there is a [rate limit], but generally largely enough for a common
digital library.

### Separator

Allow to set a div with a specific class between two blocks. May be useful to
fix some css issues, or to increase space between some blocks.

### Division

Allow to wrap a block or multiple block with a `div`. in particular to create
columns. Divisions can be nested. The css should be prepared in the theme to
managed them. By default, only a simple `aside` column of 30% is available with
class `column align-right` (or left).

### Improvements for Browse preview, Html, Item metadata, Item showcase, List of sites, Page title, Table of contents

Allow to use a specific template for some blocks, so it’s possible to display
these blocks differently in the same page or on different pages. An heading is
added too. For the table of contents, the possibility to display the table from
the root is added too.

Furthermore, the block Browse preview has new fields to display sort headings
and pagination, so it's now possible to have a specific list of items, like the
main browse view.
It has some specific templates too:
- simple carousel: this is an upgrade of the plugin [Shortcode Carousel] for
  [Omeka Classic].
- gallery display with a quick viewer too (browse-preview-gallery). This one has
  a specific option to add to the query to display thumbnails as square or
  medium: `thumbnail_size=medium`.

**Warning**

When a block allows to select a template, the filename must start with the same
string than the original template, for example "table-of-contents-pages.phtml"
for the block `TableOfContents`.

Furthermore, it should exists in a module or in the current theme. Thereby, when
the module or the theme that have this template are replaced, you have to check
the pages that use it.


TODO
----

- [ ] Merge some similar blocks into a main block (with automatic upgrade).
- [ ] Integrates Shortcodes


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------
